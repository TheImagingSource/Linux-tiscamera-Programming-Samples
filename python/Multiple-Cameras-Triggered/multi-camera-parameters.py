'''
This very  sample shows, how read camera configurations from a json file
and create for each camera in the file a TIS.TIS() camera object.

It also shows, how to set the camera parameters

The created objects
are stored in a list.

After the list has been created, all cameras are started for a live video stream and
ended after a key was hit.

    A camera class is needed for having the relation of camera and its

    the live stream has been started.
    This class is inherited from TIS.TIS class.
    These properties all the ones, that are created by software:
    - white balance automatic, exposure automatic and gain automatic for older USB 2.0 cameras
    - all properties made by tcam-dutils module, e.g. Tone Mapping.
