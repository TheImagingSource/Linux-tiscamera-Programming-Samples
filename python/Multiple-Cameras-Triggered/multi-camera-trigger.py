'''
This very  sample shows, how read camera configurations from a json file
and create for each camera in the file a TIS.TIS() camera object.

It also shows, how to set the camera parameters

The created objects
are stored in a list.

After the list has been created, all cameras are started for a live video stream and
ended after a key was hit.

class CAMERA(TIS.TIS):
    '''
    A camera class is needed for having the relation of camera and its
    json properties, because some properties can be set only, after
    the live stream has been started.
    This class is inherited from TIS.TIS class.
    These properties all the ones, that are created by software:
    - white balance automatic, exposure automatic and gain automatic for older USB 2.0 cameras
    - all properties made by tcam-dutils module, e.g. Tone Mapping.

    The class has a new attribute "triggerproperty". It is configured in the json file and contains the
    property name and the values of enable and disable trigger mode. this is necessary, because USB v4l2
    and GigEVision / USB3Vision use different properties and values for enable trigger mode.

    The CAMERA class has a saveImage ,ethod, which saves the last received image. The file name is
    created from the imageprefix specified in the cameras.json file and a running nummer.
    The saveImage method is called from on_new_image() callback, which was passed to the
    appsink in the pipeline in the TIS.TIS() base class.
